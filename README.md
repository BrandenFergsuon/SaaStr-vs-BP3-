# BP3 AI Strategy Assessment vs SaaStr Playbook

**Competitive Analysis & Implementation Roadmap**  
*Prepared: January 6, 2026*  
*Source: Lenny's Podcast with Jason Lemkin – "We replaced our sales team with 20 AI agents—here's what happened"*

## Overview

This interactive document compares **SaaStr's groundbreaking AI-driven GTM (Go-To-Market) strategy** — where 20 AI agents replaced 10 human SDRs/AEs while maintaining $8M+ ARR — against **BP3's current automation and AI capabilities**.

It highlights:
- Where BP3 already has strong foundations (Salesforce + HubSpot integration, Breeze agents access, custom dashboards, website bot, LLM workflows)
- Key gaps in specialized AI agent deployment
- Prioritized 30-60-90 day action plan to adopt SaaStr-inspired strategies using our existing tools

The goal: **Accelerate BP3's transition to an AI-powered revenue engine** while leveraging our current strengths.

## Tech Stack
